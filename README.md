# Automate The Boring Stuff
These files are my solutions to end-of-chapter Practice Projects in the free, online textbook Automate The Boring Stuff by Al Sweigart.

I highly recommend this book for anyone learning to code for the first time.

I am currently learning Python as my first programming language by working through the book Automate the Boring Stuff. These are my solutions to end of chapter projects for others to see my development as a software developer.
